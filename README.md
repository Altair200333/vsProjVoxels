# vsProjVoxels

It's voxel based real-time raytracer. All graphics are computed on GPU with Opengl's frament shader.
Engine is a croped version of my previous project Mixer3D.

Scene data is stored in json, models are made in MagicaVoxel and imported as .ply files.

This programm supports 3 kinds of materials - mirror and glass and diffuse.
